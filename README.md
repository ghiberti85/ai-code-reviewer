| Animations | Framer Motion |
| Async state | TanStack Query |
| Syntax highlight | Shiki |
| LLM | Groq API — `qwen/qwen3-32b` (free tier) |

## Architecture

```
Browser → React App → POST /api/review → Vercel Edge Function → Groq API (streaming)
```

The Edge Function proxies the request to Groq, keeping the API key server-side only.
The SSE stream from Groq is transformed into a plain-text stream that the browser reads chunk by chunk.

---

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli): `npm i -g vercel`
- [Groq API key](https://console.groq.com/keys) (free)

### Local development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ghiberti85/ai-code-reviewer.git
cd ai-code-reviewer
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local
# paste your GROQ_API_KEY into .env.local
vercel dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).  
`vercel dev` runs both Vite (frontend) and the Edge Function (`/api/review`) together.

### Running tests

```bash
npm test               # run all tests once
npm run test:watch     # watch mode
npm run test:coverage  # HTML coverage report in coverage/
```

### Deploy to Vercel

#### Option A — Dashboard (no CLI needed)
1. Import the repo at **vercel.com → Add New → Project**
2. Add `GROQ_API_KEY` in **Settings → Environment Variables** before the first deploy
3. Click **Deploy**

#### Option B — CLI
```bash
vercel --prod
vercel env add GROQ_API_KEY production
vercel --prod   # redeploy to apply the env var
```

#### Option C — GitHub Actions (recommended)
Add these secrets to your GitHub repo (**Settings → Secrets → Actions**):

| Secret | Where to find it |
|--------|-----------------|
| `VERCEL_TOKEN` | vercel.com → Account Settings → Tokens |
| `VERCEL_ORG_ID` | `.vercel/project.json` → `orgId` after first `vercel` run |
| `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` | `.vercel/project.json` → `projectId` |

After that, every merge to `main` triggers an automatic production deploy. CI runs on every push.

---

## Environment variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GROQ_API_KEY` | Yes | Groq API key — [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com/keys) |

**Never commit `.env.local`** — it is already in `.gitignore`.

---

## Security

- `GROQ_API_KEY` never reaches the browser — all LLM calls go through the Edge Function
- Input validated and limited to 50 KB per request
- Language parameter validated against an allowlist
- Groq API errors logged server-side, generic message returned to client
- Security headers on all responses: CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, nosniff, Permissions-Policy
- User code stored only in the browser's localStorage, never in a database

See [docs/SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md) for the full threat model.
